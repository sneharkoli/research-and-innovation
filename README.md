# Research and Innovation Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains implementations and examples for research and innovation projects, focusing on cutting-edge software engineering solutions and emerging technologies.

## Featured Project: Health Feedback Form Application

### üè• Health Feedback Form - Web-based Health Data Collection Platform

A comprehensive web application for collecting and visualizing health-related data with demographic trend analysis.

**üåê Live Demo:** [Health Feedback Form](https://sneharkoli.github.io/research-and-innovation/health-feedback-form/)

#### Key Features
- **Interactive Health Survey**: Comprehensive form with demographic, lifestyle, and medical condition fields
- **Real-time Data Visualization**: Dashboard with Chart.js integration showing health trends and statistics
- **Privacy-Compliant**: Anonymous data collection with automatic PII removal
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- **Local Data Storage**: Client-side data persistence with export capabilities
- **Health Classification**: Automated analysis to classify responses as healthy/moderate/abnormal

#### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for interactive charts and graphs
- **Storage**: localStorage for client-side data persistence
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages with automated deployment
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant design

#### Quick Start
1. Visit the [live application](https://sneharkoli.github.io/research-and-innovation/health-feedback-form/)
2. Fill out the health feedback form
3. View aggregated results on the dashboard
4. Export data for further analysis

## GitHub Pages Deployment

### Automatic Deployment
This repository is configured for automatic GitHub Pages deployment:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

2. **Access the Application**:
   - Main site: `https://sneharkoli.github.io/research-and-innovation/`
   - Health Form: `https://sneharkoli.github.io/research-and-innovation/health-feedback-form/`

### Manual Deployment Setup
If you need to set up deployment manually:

```bash
# 1. Ensure your repository has the health-feedback-form directory
# 2. Create .nojekyll file (already included)
# 3. Push changes to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy health feedback form to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main

# 4. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
# 5. Access at: https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/health-feedback-form/
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow (Optional)
For automated deployment with additional processing:

1. Copy the workflow file from `tmp-workflows/deploy-health-form.yml`
2. Move it to `.github/workflows/deploy-health-form.yml`
3. Commit and push to trigger automated deployment
